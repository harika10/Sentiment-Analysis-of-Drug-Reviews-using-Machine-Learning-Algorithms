# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Drug-Reviews-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

With the growing availability and popularity of
opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal
blogs, new opportunities and challenges are rising exponentially.
The abundance of data has made it easy for data scientists
to analyse and draw conclusions about public’s opinions and
behaviour. Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which
identifies and extracts subjective information in source material,
and helps a business to understand the social sentiment of their
brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations.
We have briefly discussed about sentiment analysis and its related
work in the domain from all around the world. The dataset being
used is called ”Drug Review Dataset” which contains patient’s
reviews on various drugs. We have applied multiple machine
learning algorithms to build our classifier namely, Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
and Random Forest. Their results in terms of accuracy and
other performance metrics have been discussed. Lastly, we have
evaluated performance of all classifiers and have concluded that
LSTM achieves best accuracy among other classifiers.
